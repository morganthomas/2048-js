<h1 class="page-header">2048 Solver AI</h1>

<p><a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a> is a very popular game by
  <a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/">Gabriele Cirulli</a>. Here is how it works: </p>

<ol>
  <li>The player is presented with a 4x4 grid, where numbered tiles randomly
  appear.</li>
  <li>They can use the arrow keys to move the tiles.</li>
  <li>If they cause two tiles
  with the same number to collide, they combine into a single tile of twice
  the value of the original tiles.</li>
  <li>As the game progresses, this causes tiles' values to increase in powers of two. </li>
  <li>The goal is to produce a 2048 tile.</li>
</ol>

<p> If you're not familiar with this game, you can

  to get a better idea of how it works!</p>

<p>2048 is a challenging game for humans; but I have written an AI which reliably
  wins at it. Here you can watch the AI play. <a href="#how">See below</a> for a technical
  explanation of how it works.</p>

<h2>Technical Explanation</h2>
<a name="how"></a>

<p>The AI works by combining some simple ideas from game AI with some
simple ideas from 2048 strategy.</p>

<p>We can think of a game of 2048 as a game between the "player" and the
  "computer." In the AI, these are actually two parts of the same computer program,
  but it is useful to think of them as two separate entities. Each time
  the player moves, the computer randomly adds a new tile to the board, of value
  either 2 or 4. We can think of this placement of a random tile as the computer's "move."</p>

<p>The basic problem is to write an algorithm which decides, in a given position
  (i.e., a given board setup),
  what the best move to make is for the player. The best move is the one which results in the
  best position; so the problem reduces to finding an algorithm which measures how good
  (how desirable) a given position is. The "goodness" of a position is measured
  by a number, called the position's "utility." This is just an arbitrary number
  which is assigned by the position evaluation algorithm to attempt to quantify how
  strategically desirable the position is.</p>

<p>We calculate the utility of a position by looking at the utility of the various
  positions that it can evolve into. We can think of the possible futures of a
  game as a tree, where each of the player's possible moves creates a branch,
  and each of the computer's possible moves creates a branch.</p>

<p>We search this tree to a certain depth. At the leaves where we stop our
  search, we compute the utility of those "terminal positions" using a heuristic
  algorithm. Then we combine these results to get the utility of positions
  further up in the tree.</p>

<p>The utility of a position on the player's turn can be calculated as the maximum
  of the utilities of the positions that result from the player's possible moves.
  This works because we can assume that the player will always play the move
  with the highest utility.</p>

<p>The utility of a position on the computer's turn (when it is about to generate
  a random tile) can be calculated as the average of the utilities of the
  positions that can result from the computer's move, weighted by how probable
  they are. This works because the computer moves randomly.</p>

<p>The problem, then, reduces to finding a way to measure the utility of the
  terminal positions in the search. We can't measure the utilities of these
  positions by further lookahead; so we have to employ some knowledge of 2048
  strategy to make a heuristic guess at how good the positions are.</p>

<p>A basic strategy in 2048 is the "corner strategy." One tries to put one's
  highest tiles on the top row, and on the second-from-top row when the top
  row fills up. (One could also use any other edge of the board instead of the top row.) One tries
  to arrange the tiles so that the highest tile is in the top left corner, and
  the value of the tiles decreases as one moves away from this point.</p>

<p>We use this basic strategic idea to come up with a formula which measures
  the utility of a terminal position. The formula is designed to give
  higher scores to positions which arrange the tiles in ways more closely
  approximating the corner strategy's requirements. For example, it gives
  more points for a high tile if the tile is closer to the top left corner;
  it gives points for keeping the bottom two rows mostly clear; and it takes
  away points for having a high tile in the bottom two rows.</p>

<p>This fairly straightforward approach works remarkably well. The AI
  almost always wins (i.e., produces the 2048 tile), and it is much better at the game
  than most humans (including the author). However, it is probably not as
  good as the best humans. Though verifiable information about human high scores
  in 2048 is difficult to find, it seems to be the case that the best humans
  do better than the program does.</p>

<p>The program could be made better by improving the function for measuring
  the utility of terminal positions. Statistical tuning can likely play a
  role here; one could try out different values of the various parameters
  in the formula, determine which ones do best using statistics, and
  select the values of the parameters accordingly.</p>

<p>Another possible improvement would be to increase the search depth
  by figuring out rules or heuristics which let us avoid searching some parts of
  the move tree. Chess AI programs, for example, use
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning">alpha-beta pruning</a>,
  a technique which lets them avoid searching some parts of the move tree by
  proving that those portions cannot be relevant. Alpha-beta pruning is not
  applicable to 2048, because the technique assumes that both players try
  to play their best move, whereas in 2048 the computer simply moves randomly.
  Though alpha-beta pruning is not applicable to 2048, there may be other similar
  techniques which let us prove, or guess, that we can avoid searching certain
  parts of the move tree. This could let us search the interesting parts of
  the move tree more deeply, hopefully getting better outcomes.</p>

<!-- <p>In any two-player game, you can think of the possible ways the game can
  proceed as a tree. The current state of the game is the root of the tree.
  Each possible move of the active player creates a branch from the root.
  From each of those branches, each possible move of the other player creates
  another branch; and so forth.</p> -->
